# Ready! API LucyBot Plugin

The Ready! API Plugin for [LucyBot](https://lucybot.com) allows you to instantly create LucyBot portals for any of your REST APIs.

## Usage

Once you've installed the LucyBot plugin via the plugin manager, right-click on a REST project and select "Create LucyBot Portal":

You'll be presented with a welcome screen:

From here you can [view an example](https://lucybot.com/portals/hacker_news), [try the interactive tutorial](https://lucybot.com/demo), or choose "Upload my API" to get started:

![LucyBot Upload](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucybot/soapui-lucybot-plugin/master/readme/img/upload.png)

Select which API you want to upload, specify the host, protocol, and version, and click "OK". The plugin will generate a [Swagger Specification](http://swagger.io) for the API and upload it to LucyBot, where you're free to preview the result, make changes, and publish to the gallery.
